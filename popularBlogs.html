                        <h1>MrBeast Wants to Avenge PewDiePie by Overtaking T-Series YouTube Subscriptions</h1>
                        <p>
                            YouTube content creator MrBeast believes that he will 
                            eventually overtake top-subscribed channel T-Series and 
                            get revenge for PewDiePie. PewDiePie was once the 
                            most-subscribed channel on all of YouTube, holding the honor
                            for years. Eventually, India-based media company T-Series 
                            started to close in on PewDiePie's subscriber count. This 
                            resulted in a prolonged feud between the two channels, which 
                            PewDiePie eventually lost.
